## data collction
- first i wanted to do the character analysis on what the characters were actually saying. 
- noticed not enough material in the Roman so therefore i decided to broaden the data collection to also the behaviour patterns.
- i overfle the whole roman as i could not just filter via command f the names as woolf often uses he or she, which made the process more time consumin than initiated
